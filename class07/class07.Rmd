## More on function writing
First we will revisit our function from last day

```{r}
source("http://tinyurl.com/rescale-R")
```

Test the **rescale()** function

```{r}
# This code is from the source that we installed
rescale <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE, ...) {
   rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)
   answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
   if(plot) {
     plot(answer, ...)
}
   return(answer)
}

rescale(1:10)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rescale(c(1:10, "string"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1:10, "string")
is.numeric(x)
!is.numeric(x)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This code is already in the source that we installed
# It uses a stop function
# A warning could have been used to.
# Difference between stop() and warning() is that warning will continue going while stop will terminate the code
rescale2 <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE, ...) {
   if( !is.numeric(x) ) {
      stop("Input x should be numeric", call.=FALSE)
   }
   rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)
   answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
   if(plot) {
      plot(answer, ...)
}
   return(answer)
}
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rescale2(x)
```

## Function practice

Write a function to identify NA elements in two vectors

Start with a simple example input where I know what the answer should be
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,NA,3,NA)
y <- c(NA,3,NA,3,4)

```


```{r}
is.na(x)
```


```{r}
is.na(y)
```

I am looking for he positions where it is TRUE in both vectors
```{r}
is.na(x)
is.na(y)
is.na(x) & is.na(y)
sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
```

This is my working snippet of code that I can use as the body of my first function.

```{r}
both_na <-function(x, y) {
  sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

```{r}
both_na(x, y)
```

```{r}
both_na(c(NA, NA, NA), c(NA, NA, 1))
```

```{r}
both_na(c(NA, NA, NA), c(1, NA, NA))

```

```{r}
both_na(c(NA,NA,NA), c(1, NA, NA, NA))
```

```{r}
both_na(c(1, NA, NA), c(1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```


Check if the length of our inputs are equal

```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, NA)
y <- c(1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
length(x) != length(y)
```

```{r}
3 != 2
```

```{r}
both_na2 <- function(x, y) {
  if(length(x) != length(y)) {
   stop("Input x and y should be the same length")
}
  sum( is.na(x) & is.na(y) )
}
```

Let's try to both_na3() function with extra features
```{r}
both_na3 <- function(x, y) {

  if(length(x) != length(y)) {
    stop("Input x and y should be vectors of the same length")
  }
  
  na.in.both <- ( is.na(x) & is.na(y) )
  na.number  <- sum(na.in.both)
  na.which   <- which(na.in.both)
  message("Found ", na.number, " NA's at position(s):",
          paste(na.which, collapse=", ") )
  
  return( list(number=na.number, which=na.which) )
}

x <- c(1, 2, NA, 3, NA)
y <-  c(NA, 3, NA, 3, NA)
both_na3(x, y)
```

```{r}
which(c(F,F,F,T))
```

PRACTICE (my brainstorm)
```{r}
x <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
min(x)

sum(x)
sum(x) - min(x)

(sum(x) - min(x))/(length(x)-1)
```

This grade function takes the sum of the grades, subtracts the sum by the minimum value, and then divides it by the total number of entries minus 1 (since the lowest grade is dropped)
```{r}
grade <- function(x) {
    (sum(x) - min(x))/(length(x)-1)
}

```


To create a function when you have the body, you could go to CODE --> EXTRACT FUNCTION
```{r}
grade1 <- function(x) {
  (sum(x) - min(x))/(length(x)-1)
}
```


Now we'll test out this grade function
```{r}
x <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
grade(x)
```

But what happens when there's an NA?
The sum of the vector becomes NA. The length is okay though; only sum is the issue.
To combat this, I should change the NA values to 0. 
```{r}
y <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
is.na(min(y))
sum(y)

length(y)
grade(y)

min(y)
is.na(min(y))


#grade(y)

```

Okay, let's restart our brainstorm here. Let's go through each value in the vector and then replace each NA spot with 0 by assigning that spot as a new value. 
```{r}
a <-c(NA, NA, 100, 100, 100)

for (c in 1:length(a)) {
  spot <- a[c]
  if (is.na(spot)) {
    a[c] <-  0
  }
}

```

The code above worked! Let's put that into our new grade2 function. 
This new grade function replaces each NA spot with a 0. With the new vector, we will grade it just like we did in the first grade functino. 
```{r}
grade2 <- function(x) {
  
  for (c in 1:length(x)) {
    spot <- x[c]
    if (is.na(spot)) {
      x[c] <-  0
    }
  }

  (sum(x) - min(x))/(length(x)-1)
}
```



```{r}
grade2(a)
grade2(x)
grade2(y)
```

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput"

```

First, we have to read the table from the csv data that we downloaded from the website. 
```{r}
studentdata <-read.table("student_homework (2).csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

Instead of using read.table with all those arguments, we could do read.csv. We could also do row.names = 1 so that the first column becomes the row names
```{r}
students <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1) 
grade2(students[1,])

ans <- apply(students, 1, grade2)
```


```{r}
sort(ans, decreasing = TRUE)
```


#Let's move on to the last part of class wooooo

## One last function example

Find the intersectino of two sets
```{r}
x <- df1$IDs
y <- df2$IDs

intersect(x,y)
```

```{r}
x
y
x%in%y
x[x%in%y]
```

```{r}
y%in%x
y[y%in%x]
```

cbind = column bind
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gene_intersect <- function(x, y) {
  cbind(x[x%in%y], 
        y[y%in%x])
}
```


```{r}
merge(df1, df2, by="IDs")
```


Don't do this! Install the package in the console.
# ```{r}
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install()
# ```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(ans)
ans
```
