Running DESeq2
--------------

Nice! Now lets setup the DESeqDataSet object required for the DESeq() function and then run the DESeq pipeline. This is again similar to our last days hands-on session.

``` r
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData2,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```

    ## estimating size factors

    ## estimating dispersions

    ## gene-wise dispersion estimates

    ## mean-dispersion relationship

    ## final dispersion estimates

    ## fitting model and testing

Get our results

``` r
res <- results(dds)
head(res)
```

Now we will make a volcano plot, a commonly produced visualization from this type of data that we introduced last day. Basically it's a plot of log2 fold change vs -log adjusted p-value.

The reason why we take the log of the pvalue is because the p values are really tiny (and we use the negative to turn it into a positive value). So, the log of values less than 0.01 will only get bigger and bigger.

``` r
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
abline(v = c(-2,2), col = "green", lwd = 2)
abline(h = -log(0.01), col = "green", lwd = 2)
```

![](class15_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

``` r
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res))

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (abs(res$padj) < 0.01 & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ))
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
abline(v = c(-2,2), col = "green", lwd = 2)
abline(h = -log(0.01), col = "green", lwd = 2)
```

Section 2. Pathway Analysis
---------------------------

Here we are going to use the gage package for pathway analysis. Once we have a list of enriched pathways, we're going to use the pathview package to draw pathway diagrams, shading the molecules in the pathway by their degree of up/down-regulation.

Pathway.id comes from the above (hsa04110 Cell cycle)

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string

keggresids
```

    ## [1] "hsa04740" "hsa04640" "hsa00140" "hsa04630" "hsa04976"

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")

Section 3. Gene Ontology (GO)
-----------------------------

We can also do a similar procedure with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms. go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF ontologies. Let’s focus on BP (a.k.a Biological Process) here.

``` r
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

Section 4. Reactome Analysis
----------------------------

Reactome is database consisting of biological molecules and their relation to pathways and processes. Reactome, such as many other tools, has an online software available (<https://reactome.org/>) and R package available (<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReactomePA.html>).

``` r
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length(sig_genes)))
```

    ## [1] "Total number of significant genes: 8146"

``` r
write.table(sig_genes, file = "significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

Then, to perform pathway analysis online go to the Reactome website (<https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#TOOL=AT>). Select “choose file” to upload your significant gene list. Then, select the parameters “Project to Humans”, then click “Analyze”.

Q: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

The Endosomal/Vacuolar pathway has the most significant "entities p-value" of 8.61E-4.
